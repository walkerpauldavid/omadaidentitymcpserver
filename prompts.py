Optional filters:
- System ID (to filter by specific system)
- Context ID (to filter by specific business context)

**Step 4: Create Access Request**
Finally, I'll create the access request with:
- Reason for access
- Business context
- Resource(s) to request
- Optional: Valid from/to dates

Let's get started! Please provide:
1. The email address of the person requesting access
2. Your bearer token (from oauth_mcp_server)

**Step 3: Make Decision**
For each approval, you can:

        """
        return """I'll guide you through getting an authentication token using Device Code flow.

**Authentication Steps:**

**Using oauth_mcp_server:**

1. **Start Device Authentication**
   Call: start_device_auth()
   This gives you:
   - A user code (e.g., "A1B2C3D4")
   - A verification URL (https://microsoft.com/devicelogin)
   - Device code (used internally)

2. **Complete Authentication in Browser**
   - Open the verification URL in your browser
   - Enter the user code when prompted
   - Sign in with your Microsoft credentials
   - Approve the permissions

3. **Complete Device Authentication**
   Call: complete_device_auth()
   This returns your bearer token

4. **Use the Token**
   Pass the bearer token to any Omada function:
   Example: `get_pending_approvals(impersonate_user="user@domain.com", bearer_token="eyJ0...")`

The bearer token:
- Stays in the conversation context
- No need to save to files
- Valid for ~1 hour
- Use it for all subsequent operations

**Ready to authenticate?**
Type: "start device authentication"

    def troubleshooting_workflow():
        """
        Common troubleshooting tips for Omada MCP operations.
        """
        return """Here are solutions to common issues:

**Issue: "Missing bearer_token parameter"**
Solution: All Omada functions require authentication. Use oauth_mcp_server to get a token:
1. Run: start_device_auth()
2. Complete auth in browser
3. Run: complete_device_auth()
4. Use the returned token in your Omada function calls

**Issue: "Could not find identity for email"**
Solution: Check that:
- Email address is correct and complete
- Field name is "EMAIL" (all caps)
- User exists in Omada system

**Issue: "No resources found"**
Solution: This could mean:
- User doesn't have permission to request any resources
- Filters are too restrictive (try removing filters)
- Context or system ID is incorrect

**Issue: "Invalid entity type"**
Solution: Valid entity types are:
- Identity, Resource, Role, Account, Application, System, CalculatedAssignments, AssignmentPolicy

**Issue: "Authentication failed - token may be expired"**
Solution: Tokens expire after ~1 hour. Get a new token:
1. Run: complete_device_auth() (if you've already started auth)
2. Or start fresh with: start_device_auth()

**Issue: Field Names Not Working**
Solution: Omada field names are UPPERCASE and specific:
- Use "EMAIL" not "email", "MAIL", or "EMAILADDRESS"
- Use "FIRSTNAME" not "firstname" or "FirstName"
- Use "LASTNAME" not "lastname" or "LastName"

**Still having issues?**
Check the logs:
- Log file location shown at startup
- Set LOG_LEVEL_<function_name>=DEBUG in .env for detailed logs
